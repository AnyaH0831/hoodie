The sunset paintings in order from top to down, left to right: "The Cliff, Ã‰tretat, Sunset", "The Houses of Parliament, Sunset", [The middle painting I did] "Sunset on the Seine in Winter", "At Le Petit-Gennevilliers, Sunset", and "Cliff at Pourville, Sunset" 

About the design of the back of the hoodie, I mainly focused on changing the format of how the different paintings are placed for it to show some sort of unity, making them feel like a unified piece. Thus, I cropped some edges of each of the paintings [Other than the central one] to make them fit together.
